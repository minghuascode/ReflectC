C Reflection  2011-12-3


A set of tools to bring reflection ability into C. 

Though C is statically typed, the introspective part of 
reflection can be implemented easily. The tools 
will start with type introspection. Once that is done 
we will explore other possibility. 

The target use of the C reflection will be mostly for 
testing, debugging, troubleshooting at this time.
